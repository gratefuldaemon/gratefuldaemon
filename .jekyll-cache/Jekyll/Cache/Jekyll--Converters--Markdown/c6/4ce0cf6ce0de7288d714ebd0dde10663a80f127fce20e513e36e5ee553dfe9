<p>I recently saw <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxRiNUY4z5U">this</a> youtube video in my recommended to me and decided to watch it because I do not like myself - in this video he setups his dream library with over 1000 books, most new now my recommendations are filled with this vile trend of buying thousands of pounds worth of books, that is not hyperbole they mostly have over 1000 books and if we‚Äôre aggresivly conservative and assume ¬£2 per book most are spending at least ¬£2000 on books, a more accurate average would be ¬£5 per book, this is hyperconsumerism</p>

<h2 id="b-but-they-mightve-read-the-books">b-but they might‚Äôve read the books</h2>
<p>unless you intend to reread the book owning it is mindless consumerism disguised as a hobby</p>

<h3 id="b-but-they-might-have-emotional-value">b-but they might have emotional value</h3>
<p>Sure maybe a couple do, but a thousand? get fucked you dishonest twat.</p>

<h1 id="wastefulness">Wastefulness</h1>
<p>Buying something for the enjoyment you get from purchasing something, for the sake of ownership or (exclusively) for the sake of performance is wasteful and reduces you to an enslaved animal</p>

<h2 id="b-but-theyll-read-them">b-but they‚Äôll read them</h2>
<p>Firstly I doubt it if they have 500 unread books (they usually have close to 1000 unread) and they read 1 book a year it‚Äôd take them 10 years to get through - do you really believe they only have 500 unread and will maintain an average pace of 50 books a year for 10 years? most of these fucks will be literal corpses before they‚Äôve read them and even if they aren‚Äôt HOW THE FUCK DO YOU KNOW WHAT BOOKS YOU‚ÄôLL WANT TO/ENJOY READING IN 10 YEARS TIME? ARE YOU ALWAYS GOING TO BE THE EXACT SAME PERSON? DO YOU NOT CHANGE?</p>

<h1 id="why-i-hate-it">Why I hate it</h1>
<p>These people are consumed by capitalism and their genuine desires (such as reading) are subverted then hijacked by the system itself until they cannot tell the difference between engaging in the thing (reading) and engaging in the imitation of the thing (owning and talking about books) - I‚Äôve not addressed the ‚Äúpeople‚Äù who say things ‚Äúakin to reading books and buying books are two different hobbies‚Äù but my use of quotes around the word people there should make my view quite clear.</p>
