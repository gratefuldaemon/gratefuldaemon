<p>I recently switched to arch linux then installed minecraft, it told me to log into my account, I did, it sent me a code, I entered it, it told me I need to migrate to a microcock account, I did.</p>

<p>Then it told me my account is locked and I need to give them my phone number - fuck off. My mojang account has existed and been used since I was in highschool do you really think Iâ€™m not a real person? I have access to the email and minecraft account</p>

<p>Out of principle I made a new account (microsoft do not need my phone number so I will not give it them) - Then after making my new account I obviously need to buy minecraft again, fuck it sure Iâ€™ve got enough value out of minecraft to justify it, I go to the minecraft site (Iâ€™m logged into the minecraft launcher so I just click to buy minecraft) then the site gives me fucking access denied - the site is refusing to let me use it.</p>

<p>I will never buy minecraft again, I donâ€™t care about updates or anything from now on not only will I only play cracked minecraft I will go out of my way to pirate any games I want thatâ€™re made by microsoft.</p>
